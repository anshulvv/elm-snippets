#  ⭐  ⭐  ️NOTE  ⭐   ⭐  
I am **leaving this project** in this state because I think I don't have the required knowledge of Elm as of now. Will definitely get back to it once I get some experience with things.

I got to this conclusion after watching this video by Pit Capitain:

Note that I am not demotivated by the video, instead the opposite, I am so much motivated by it. I just want to come back to this project as soon as possible by learning as much as possible. 


# Elm Snippets

An experimental project to share code snippets written in [elm-lang](https://elm-lang.org/)

### WHY??

Because it is hard to find reference/example code in Elm. Sometimes, even ChatGPT gives wrong info on the topic and doesn't know the code.

#### NOTE TO SELF

I will continue pushing directly to `main` untill I get a stable working version of the code. After that I'll start making `feature` branches for new features.
