# Elm Snippets

An experimental project to share code snippets written in [elm-lang](https://elm-lang.org/)

### WHY??

Because it is hard to find reference/example code in Elm. Sometimes, even ChatGPT gives wrong info on the topic and doesn't know the code.

#### NOTE TO SELF

I will continue pushing directly to `main` untill I get a stable working version of the code. After that I'll start making `feature` branches for new features.
